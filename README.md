### Project Title
bikeshare-udacity-project

### Description
This project uses Python, numpy and pandas in order to provide the user with statistical data on bike rentals made in the cities of Washington, Chicago and New York City. The user will be provided with an interactive interface where one can select the desired city data and apply a month/weekday filter if desired. The program will then enable the user to pre-check the filtered data by taking a look at its raw contents. Ultimately, statistical data such as bike rides by gender, average rental durations or most favorite start stations are determined and presented to the user.

### Files used
This program depends on three external data files containing the csv data for the cities in question. If these files are missing, the program cannot apply its calculations but will detect the missing files. All related CSV files can be downloaded through [Udacity](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/August/5b7b7aca_bikeshare-2/bikeshare-2.zip).
